# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This project is part of the foundations course of The Odin Project.

During this project I applied my newly learned JS knowledge of DOM manipulation.

I was success in creating an interactive webpage to play the critically acclaimed game of Rock Paper Scissors.

Click [here](https://pakmangames.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/) to play for yourself. (Works best on a vertical monitor lol)

Here is a preview of what the page looks like:
